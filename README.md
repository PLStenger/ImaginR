# Analysing color phenotype and their variations on Pearl oyster *Pinctada margaritifera* (Linnaeus, 1758) with `ImaginR`
An R Package to delimit the color phenotype of the pearl oyster's inner shell (Pinctada margaritifera) and to characterize there color variations (by the HSV color code system).

The pearl oyster, *Pinctada margaritifera*, represents the second economic resource of French Polynesia.
It is one of the only bivalves expressing a large varied range of inner shell color, and by correlation, of pearl color.
This phenotypic variability is partly under genetic control, but also under environmental influence.
With `ImaginR`, it's now possible to delimit the color phenotype of the pearl oyster's inner shell and to characterize their color variations (by the HSV color code system) with pictures.

# Quick start (this section will be completed soon after publication of the linked study)
Put all your pictures in one folder. 

Open R. 

`setwd()` in this folder.

Run the main fonction is `OutPutResult()`. 

Let's see the results !
