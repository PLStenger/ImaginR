# Delimit and analyse color hues & color variations with `ImaginR`

## Analysing color phenotype and their variations on Pearl oyster *Pinctada margaritifera* (Linnaeus, 1758) with `ImaginR`
An R Package to delimit the color phenotype of the pearl oyster's inner shell (Pinctada margaritifera) and to characterize there color variations (by the HSV color code system).

The pearl oyster, *Pinctada margaritifera*, represents the second economic resource of French Polynesia.
It is one of the only bivalves expressing a large varied range of inner shell color, and by correlation, of pearl color.
This phenotypic variability is partly under genetic control, but also under environmental influence.
With `ImaginR`, it's now possible to delimit the color phenotype of the pearl oyster's inner shell and to characterize their color variations (by the HSV color code system) with pictures.

# Install from CRAN:
`install.packages("ImaginR")`

# Install from Github: (much more up to date)

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("PLStenger/ImaginR")
    library("ImaginR")


# Quick start
Put all your pictures in one folder. 

Open R. 

`setwd()` in the folder with the pictures.

Run the main fonction is `OutPutResult()`. 

Let's see the results !

Warning: If you need to redo analysis, please delete or change the name of the both OutPutAnalysis.txt and results.csv files in order to avoid confrontations.

# Update 06/12/2020 : Using `ImaginR` for fluorescent microscope images.

If you have already use old `ImaginR` version on your current analysis, please, save your work, quit R and R Studio. Re-open your file, don't run `ImaginR`, don't use the `ImaginR` CRAN version, because it wasn't already up-to-date. Please, install the new version from github:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("PLStenger/ImaginR")
    library("ImaginR")

Then put your pictures in a folder, and set your working directory on it with `setwd()` or scroll with the R studio finder on the right to found the folder, clic on the button from R Studio on the right 'more' and then clic on 'Set As Working Directory'.

Only for fluorescent microscope images with black background, run this function (without anaything into the brackets):

`OutPutResult_microscopy()`

Normally, two files will be created into your folder (if your pictures are heavy, and.or if you have a lot of pictures, this could be take time (depend alos of your computer RAM power).
The first, the 'OutPutAnalysis_microscopy.txt' file is the raw results, and the second file, "results_microscopy.csv", is your results with the picture's names (warning: the header is shifted, will be fixed later).
